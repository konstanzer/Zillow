I am a data scientist at Zillow. This morning, I received the following email:

	We want to be able to predict the values of single-unit properties that the tax district assesses using the property data from those with a transaction during the "hot months" of May-August 2017.

	Property taxes are assessed at the county level. The data has the tax amounts and tax value of the home so it shouldn't be too hard to calculate. Please include in your report to us the distribution of tax rates for each county so that we can see how much they vary within the properties in the county and the rates most properties hover around.

	This is separate from the model you will build because, if you use tax amount in your model, you would be using a future data point to predict a future data point. For prediction purposes, we won't know tax amount until we know tax value.

Audience: Zillow data team

Goals:
* Predict values of tax-assessed, single-unit properties bought or sold between May and August 2017. (Exclude tax amount from model.)
* Label properties' states and counties via tax rates calculated using tax values and tax amounts.
* Report tax rate distributions by county.

Artifacts:
* slides w/ drivers of single-unit property values - for 5 min presentation
* repo notebook w/ pipeline, 2 t-tests + viz, baseline and model, address email
* readme w/ reproduction instructions, goals, data dict, takeaways

## Hypotheses

### Mann-Whitney U Test

H<sub>0</sub> The sample of home values from County A comes from the same population as County B (i.e. that they both have the same median).

H<sub>1</sub> The samples from County A and County B come from different populations.

LAC and OC
* t-stat  = 40907982
* p-value = 9e-93

LAC and VC
* t-stat  = 13718420
* p-value = 1e-21

OC and VC
* t-stat  = 7250266
* p-value = 1e-5

**Reject all the nulls null. Median home values are different.**

### Pearson's correlation

H<sub>0</sub> There is no linear correlation between house value and year built.

H<sub>1</sub> There is a linear correlation between monthly charges and months tenure.

* Pearson correlation = 0.20876
* p-value             = 0.00000

**Reject the null.**
